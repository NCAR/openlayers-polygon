# Polygon for OpenLayers2

`eol-ol2-polygon.js` provides a polygon for an OpenLayers2 map.
An example map is in `eol-ol2-polygon.html`.

See it in action on [Github](https://ncar.github.io/openlayers-polygon/ol2/eol-ol2-polygon.html)

`pecangrid.html` adds a layer of gridded site locations.
The hexagon displayed on the map can be fit around these site dots.
The motivating example was to plan temporary locations for complete radar coverage of an area.

The `work` dir contains various examples and intermediate/partial
code that may or may not still function.
