# Polygon for OpenLayers3

`eol-polygon.js` provides a polygon for an OpenLayers3 map.
Requires that jQuery is loaded first.

An example map is in `eol-polygon.html`.

The example `poly-grid.html` also includes a layer
of gridded site locations. The hexagon displayed on the map
can be fit around these site dots. The motivating example was
to plan temporary locations for complete radar coverage of an area.

The `work` dir contains various examples and intermediate/partial
code that may or may not still function.
